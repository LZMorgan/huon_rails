        <p>The <em>Huon d'Auvergne</em> romance-epic is conserved in four Franco-Italian and seven Tuscan witnesses. The following digital critical editions present the entirety of the Franco-Italian manuscript tradition, which spans a full century from 1341 (the Berlin manuscript) to 1441 (the Turin manuscript). The Padua and Bologna witnesses date from the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries. The Franco-Italian texts vary significantly in content, language, and manuscript completeness. Only one narrative segment––the Hell scene––is present in all four witnesses. The Barbieri witness, named for fragmentary its sixteenth-century owner Giovanni Maria Barbieri, is fragmentary and conserves only the Hell scene. For the Berlin manuscript, which is the most complete textually, Shira Schwam-Baird has prepared an accompanying English translation. The Hell scene comparison section presents the four versions of this important narrative passage and renders visually the textual variation between the four iterations. The editions are powered by <a href="http://dcl.ils.indiana.edu/teibp/">TEI Boilerplate</a>, developed by John Walsh at Indiana University to present TEI editions on the web.
