  <br/>

  <h2 class="praxis">Version 1.0.0 Statement</h2>

    <p>Version 1.0.0 of the Huon Digital Archive, published August 31, 2017, consists of a base transcription of all four Huon d’Auvergne textual witnesses. The editorial criteria used to establish the editions will evolve as the team continues its research and, for this reason, all scholars citing our work must indicate the version number. We recommend contacting us directly to inquire if corrections have been made to the segment you wish to cite. We will provide access to the development site in which the texts appear in their entirety to scholars who request it. We update our website regularly with changes posting every Saturday evening, and we version our website according to the standards of Semantic Versioning, described in <a href="http://semver.org/">this document.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Version 1.0 of Huon d'Auvergne Editions and Translation</dt>
        <p>In their current form, the editions and the translation of Huon d'Auvergne are neither complete nor authoritative. Although the texts are available to the public, the editorial team is currently extensively revising them for accuracy and clarity. The definitive texts will be released with Version 2.0.</p>
