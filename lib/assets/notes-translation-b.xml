                <note xml:id="trans240" type="interp" resp="#SSB">At this point, after Berart's reproach, Huon switches sides and fights alongside the Auvergnats, his men. (In line 140 the king had announced that he wanted Huon on his side, which explains Huon's awkward position. See also lines 221 and 266.)</note>
                <note xml:id="trans393" type="lit" resp="#SSB">Literally: [...] many have not remained indoors</note>
                <note xml:id="trans418" type="codic" resp="#SSB">The illuminator places the king on the ground, not on his horse. See also line 410 where the king puts his hand on Saudin's shoulder with his eyes seemingly closed, an awkward movement when on horseback.</note>

                <note xml:id="trans531" type="alttrans" resp="#SSB">The translation is based on understand <hi rend="italic">vera</hi> as deriving from the verb "veer" (refuse, forbid, prohibit). However the line could be transcribed as <hi rend="italic">Mais ni onserent tant qui·l roy levera</hi> which would give the alternative translation: But they didn't dare until the king got up (there are multiple instances of the reflexive use of this verb without a reflexive pronoun, as in lines 2610, 2646, 2974, 8032 and others).</note>

                <note xml:id="trans704" type="interp" resp="#SSB">The "he" is ambiguous here; either it is Charles whom Saudin justifies as the overlord of Hell, or it is the Devil who would serve as Charles's vassal.</note>

                <note xml:id="trans927" type="lex" resp="#SSB">The word <hi rend="italic">pelegrin</hi> (sometimes appearing as <hi rend="italic">peregrin</hi>) can also be translated as "stranger" or even "traveler." The miniatures that depict this disguised devil (61R, 63R, 75V) show him in the typical traveling clothes of a medieval pilgrim. However, the hospitality shown him here obeys the Biblical injunction to show hospitality to a stranger, not only pilgrims.</note>
                <note xml:id="trans1034" type="edit" resp="#SSB">Lines 1033 and 1034 have been reversed in the translation for clarity.</note>

See Moisan, <hi rend="italic">Répertoire des noms propres</hi>, Tome II Volume 3 (Droz: 1986), p. 872. On the other hand, Huon's next stop is Calabria, so Sicily is more likely the translation.</note>

                <note xml:id="trans2591" type="lex" resp="#SSB"><hi rend="italic">maroy</hi> here seems to be related to some dialectical words in Italian that mean "large stone"; see Pellegrini 1968 "marògna" and Basso 2000 "marogna" and "marògnola." See other instances at lines 2702, 2890, 7283, 7831 and 8097 (where it is spelled <hi rend="italic">marois</hi>). In all instances the corresponding line in Turin has some variation of "preda" or "predon" ("stone" related to OF "perron").</note>
