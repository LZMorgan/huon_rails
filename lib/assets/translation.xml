                <l n="34">Whenever the king sent for his barons,</l>

                <l n="41">He was more arrogant and presumptuous than any of them.</l>

                <l n="53">One day the king had a wish and desire</l>
                <l n="54">To see clearly the best of his men, </l>
                <l n="55">[To know] which one was the most daring and valiant.</l>
                <l n="56">He took counsel with the count of Luxembourg,</l>

                <l n="58">As to how he could see them in action.</l>
                <l n="59">They answered, "Have it announced everywhere</l>
                <l n="60">That there not remain behind anyone great or small</l>
                <l n="61">Who holds land, fief, or honor from the king,</l>
                <l n="62">That everyone come quickly to your court at Pentecost.</l>
                <l n="63">Let everyone bring either his daughter or his sister </l>
                <l n="64">Or even a cousin, or let him bring, rather, his wife;</l>
                <l n="65">For you will find a lord for the maidens,</l>
                <l n="66">And you will honor the married men:</l>
                <l n="67">For you could also create numerous new knights,</l>
                <l n="68">Dubbing many with a fine, brilliant sword.</l>
                <l n="69">Anyone who does not come will lose your love."</l>
                <l n="70">"Indeed," said Charles, "I will do this without delay."</l>
                <l n="71">So right away he called the public criers;</l>
                <l n="72">He gave the order, and they rode off</l>

                <l n="83">There came such a crowd of people </l>
                <l n="84">That twelve crowned kings were there,</l>
                <l n="85">Handsomely equipped and well-supplied:</l>
                <l n="86">There were dukes, princes, and counts.</l>
                <l n="87">People came from many lands:</l>
                <l n="88">There was the count of Artois and the count of Soissons,</l>
                <l n="89">And from Luxembourg the vassal Merigon;</l>
                <l n="90">There was the count of Auvergne, who brought by his side</l>
                <l n="91">Fair Ynide of the lovely face;</l>
                <l n="92">Also with him he brought Berart, his good cousin,</l>
                <l n="93">And Baudoin the lion-hearted,</l>
                <l n="94">With Thomas of Flanders (both of whom were from</l>
                <l n="95">The same family, as we read):</l>
                <l n="96">Both were brothers of the lovely Ynide,</l>
                <l n="97">Brothers-in-law to the good vassal Huon.</l>
                <l n="98">The count did not come unprepared;</l>
                <l n="99">Rather he had with him at least two hundred companions,</l>
                <l n="100">All of them the best of his household.</l>
                <l n="101">There was Morant, and Samson,</l>
                <l n="102">Who was Count Huon(s seneschal.</l>
                <l n="103">They went straight to Paris without stopping,</l>
                <l n="104">And halted in the neighborhood of Saint Paul, </l>
                <l n="105">So we hear. After a while they found </l>
                <l n="106">A lodging that Ynide had been hearing about for some time,</l>

                <l n="120">He was so much loved by great and small,</l>
                <l n="121">That no one said anything bad about him;</l>
                <l n="122">There was no one who wouldn't willingly suffer or die for him.</l>
                <l n="123">At Pentecost when the guests had eaten and drunk</l>
                <l n="124">At the king(s court, and the tables were taken away,</l>
                <l n="125">Charles Martel drew Count Huon aside,</l>

                <l n="866">They said nothing, and very soon they all set out.</l>
                <l n="867">The count rode all day and all night</l>
                <l n="868">Until they came to Auvergne, his good city.</l>
                <l n="869">He entered the town and dismounted at the base of the stairs.</l>
                <l n="870">For two days the count said not a word,</l>
                <l n="871">Not even speaking to his wife as he was normally wont to do.</l>
                <l n="872">"Oh, God," said Ynide, "could he have been watching</l>
                <l n="873">When the king Charles Martel was making that request of me?</l>
                <l n="874">It was foolish of me not to have told him about it when it first
                    happened;</l>
                <l n="875">But God knows the truth, and sees my fidelity,</l>
                <l n="876">And knows I concealed it all from my own dear lord</l>
                <l n="877">Because I didn(t want at that time to put hostility between them.</l>
                <l n="878">Whatever may be the result, I will ask him now</l>
                <l n="879">Why he has shown himself so angry toward me."</l>
                <l n="880">So on the third day, the lady spoke.</l>

                <l n="887">They addressed him graciously and begged him most earnestly</l>
                <l n="888">To reassure his people who were quite uneasy,</l>
                <l n="889">Saying that it would be best for him to tell them what he intended to

                <l n="890">He should take good counsel, nor should he be afraid.</l>
                <l n="891">They spoke about it and begged him so repeatedly</l>
                <l n="892">That he promised to do what they wished.</l>
                <l n="893">Then they were reassured, and he sent for his council.</l>

                <l n="895">But he hid everything regarding his great task.</l>
                <l n="896">Rather he called for setting up a great court:</l>
                <l n="897">"Let it go on for ten days, or even nine, by my faith,</l>
                <l n="898">And everyone will prepare as best he can</l>
                <l n="899">To honor me simply with his goodness.</l>
                <l n="900">Then it will be necessary for me to leave on the king(s business,</l>

                <l n="902">At that moment, when I will be separated from you,</l>

                <l n="1277">He came to Rome; there he lodged</l>
                <l n="1278">At the house of a city burgher, who served him very well,</l>

                <l n="1281">The nobleman beat his breast and prayed to God in His majesty</l>

                <l n="1288">He searched for it until he found it;</l>

                <l n="1426">Then to the count he said, "Friend, what do you seek?"</l>
                <l n="1427">And Huon answered, "For God's sake, I would beg you</l>
                <l n="1428">To allow me to come up on your swift ship,</l>
                <l n="1429">Along with my horse, which I have brought with me.</l>
                <l n="1430">If you want goods or some other payment,</l>
                <l n="1431">I will pay you as much as you like;</l>
                <l n="1432">I want to get to Athens, the amazing city."</l>
                <l n="1433">And the other answered, "That suits us very well!</l>
                <l n="1434">Come on board, for you have arrived</l>
                <l n="1435">So early that we have a good wind."</l>
                <l n="1436">So Huon boarded and thanked them and God.</l>
                <l n="1437">May God watch over the count, who was very badly lodged!</l>

                <l n="1455">The count in reply thanked him for everything.</l>
                <l n="1456">He provided for his horse in the usual way.</l>
                <l n="1457">In the meantime he believed himself completely safe,</l>

                <l n="1480">He said to them, "The entire payment will be made to you;</l>
                <l n="1481">Making a show of force will gain you nothing."</l>
                <l n="1482">At this response, several of them lost control,</l>

                <l n="1484">Like a man of prowess and valor.</l>
                <l n="1485">He hastened toward them; he lost no ground at all;</l>

                <l n="1488">They cried out their affliction at this attack,</l>

                <l n="1491">But the baron thought to himself that he could come to harm,</l>

                <l n="1493">By their navigation he would be carried to safety.</l>
                <l n="1494">So he held back and drew himself back to one side</l>
                <l n="1495">And called out to them, "What are you doing, you scoundrels?</l>
                <l n="1496">I never thought to have such a fright;</l>

                <l n="1516">And they thanked him and then swore an oath.</l>

                <l n="2545">Besides it was almost night, and he was somewhat tired,</l>
                <l n="2546">And thirst tormented him; he yearned to drink.</l>

                <l n="2550">He challenged it to a rude and fierce battle;</l>

                <l n="2552">On its head he landed a blow and such a heavy one</l>
                <l n="2553">With his sword that however didn't hurt it one bit.</l>
                <l n="2554">The sword bounced off, [the serpent] sprayed out fire</l>
                <l n="2555">That greatly damaged [Huon's] armor.</l>
                <l n="2556">After that it arched its tail in a great curve,</l>
                <l n="2557">Trying to reach the count, but he guarded himself from it.</l>
                <l n="2558">He leaped back and forth, landing many a blow,</l>

                <l n="2560">When the count saw [the situation] thus, he got angrier and angrier.</l>
                <l n="2561">The beast stood there firm, defending itself with fire and tail,</l>
                <l n="2562">And with its teeth, if it could seize anything.</l>
                <l n="2563">The count then thought of a feat of valor:</l>
                <l n="2564">He positioned himself in front of it and placed his shield before

                <l n="2565">To avoid the stink and the fire that it belched forth</l>
                <l n="2566">When opening its maw that was spewing out fire.</l>
                <l n="2567">[Huon] thrust his sword into its throat right up to the hilt;</l>
                <l n="2568">He touched its heart and at once he straightened up.</l>
                <l n="2569">When it felt death, it let out a tremendous roar</l>
                <l n="2570">So that the whole mountain reverberated with it.</l>
                <l n="2571">([The serpent] then became quiet and fell backwards.)</l>
                <l n="2572">Such a disturbance arose from that roar,</l>
                <l n="2573">That more than a thousand seven hundred came forth because of that

                <l n="2574">They issued from their lairs; they were seeking one another.</l>
                <l n="2575">The whole mountain seemed to be burning.</l>
                <l n="2576">"Holy Mary," said Huon, "may you help me!</l>

                <l n="2578">He quickly sheathed his sword;</l>
                <l n="2579">The proverb says, "He is mad who awaits a madman";</l>
                <l n="2580">The departure from the cruel place was truly good.</l>

                <l n="2733">In their appearance, it showed that they were afraid:</l>

                <l n="3302">Then they ate what they found;</l>
                <l n="3303">Night fell and they went to bed,</l>

                <l n="3308">He wanted to bring [Huon] to him, [but Huon] went the other way.</l>
                <l n="3309">The count thought that [the lion] would guard the entrance,</l>
                <l n="3310">With that he let the lion be and went to go to bed;</l>
                <l n="3311">May God think about them; [Huon] has found the devil!</l>
                <l n="3312">And [the devil] isn't teaching nor does he practice abstinence.</l>
                <l n="3313">He could quickly ruin him, he could hold him captive,</l>
                <l n="3314">But God was with them, for Huon frequently called to him</l>
                <l n="3315">With all that he ever did or said.</l>
                <l n="3316">At that moment he made the sign of the cross and said many good
                    things:</l>
                <l n="3317">He began a psalm which David had pronounced,</l>
                <l n="3318">"Set me, O Lord, a law," and then he finished it,</l>
                <l n="3319">Then he began another, "Praise the Lord, you that are his servants,"</l>
                <l n="3320">And "Let the whole earth praise, for all He does for us,"</l>
                <l n="3321">As long as he knew how to say it well he never stopped</l>
                <l n="3322">Until midnight when he fell asleep.</l>
                <l n="3323">He slept a little bit there, he tossed and turned with worry;</l>
                <l n="3324">He saw a great vision, he didn't know what it meant.</l>
                <l n="3325">He remained that way until the morning,</l>
                <l n="3326">Whereupon he said his prayers and crossed himself.</l>
                <l n="3327">For a long time he heard the voice murmuring over there,</l>
                <l n="3328">But he didn(t understand it at all; he didn(t know his language.</l>
                <l n="3329">Indeed he truly believed that it was a good thing,</l>

                <l n="3338">I believed that he stayed outside to stand guard.</l>
                <l n="3339">Many times I have heard it said that beasts have such an ability:</l>
                <l n="3340">If it senses something that is supernatural,</l>
                <l n="3341">If it is something evil, [the beast] then offers up a great prayer.</l>

                <l n="3344">Nor can one pick out a single word.</l>
                <l n="3345">And many times I have gone over there to listen,</l>
                <l n="3346">I have never seen him move or go [anywhere].</l>
                <l n="3347">I am afraid that he might be the devil,</l>
                <l n="3348">That he is here to deceive us.</l>
                <l n="3349">I'll say one thing: I want to go test him.</l>
                <l n="3350">Before I leave, I will beg</l>
                <l n="3351">That he speak more clearly to me.</l>
                <l n="3352">And if he doesn(t want to do it,</l>
                <l n="3353">I'll make him do it, if I can find a way.</l>
                <l n="3354">Come to me, don't be afraid at all.</l>
                <l n="3355">If it's dark, I'll make it light enough</l>
                <l n="3356">So that from all sides you'll be able to see."</l>
                <l n="3357">Then the count placed his hand in his bag,</l>
                <l n="3358">And pulled out the cross the pope had given him</l>
                <l n="3359">Out of great love when [Huon] came to leave.</l>
                <l n="3360">When he unwrapped it, it cast such light</l>
                <l n="3361">That he saw clearly in front [of him] as far as a bow shot.</l>
                <l n="3362">When the devil saw this, he began to cry out:</l>

                <l n="3364">I cannot look at what you have in your hand!</l>

                <l n="3366">Huon answered, "So, are you the evil one,</l>

                <l n="4235">Weeping, he kissed Samson's family,</l>

                <l n="4237">He left them without delay;</l>
                <l n="4238">He didn't bring any companion or peer with him;</l>
                <l n="4239">As for which direction to take, he left that up to Jesus.</l>
                <l n="4240">He took the road that went to the right;</l>
                <l n="4241">He began to ride, since he had a good horse,</l>
                <l n="4242">That soon distanced him from that land and household.</l>
                <l n="4243">The baron rode continuously up and down,</l>
                <l n="4244">Never forgetting to speak wisely,</l>
                <l n="4245">Rather repeating the liturgy, hour by hour;</l>
                <l n="4246">He recited a psalm that he had learned as a boy:</l>
                <l n="4247">"Remember me, O Lord," until its end.</l>
                <l n="4248">Then he would recite another that he remembered:</l>
                <l n="4249">"Troubled, [I come] to You, Lord Jesus,</l>
                <l n="4250">I cried out to You, O Lord, and we render thanks to You</l>
                <l n="4251">For all the care we have received from You."</l>
                <l n="4252">He rode until he came to the top of a hill</l>

                <l n="5156">I say it for this reason: you're going to leave now;</l>
                <l n="5157">You'll go away, [my] lords, and I'll remain here."</l>
                <l n="5158">"Lady," said Tholomeus, "indeed it is praiseworthy of you</l>
                <l n="5159">When you upset the order of the king!</l>
                <l n="5160">Think, my lady, what could happen."</l>
                <l n="5161">"Friend," said the countess, "I have been thinking about it for a long
                    time,</l>
                <l n="5162">And for that reason I have replied immediately without delay."</l>

                <l n="5163">Tholomeus fell silent and bowed his head.</l>
                <l n="5164"><milestone n="36Ra" unit="fol."/>Next spoke Hugo of Savine;</l>
                <l n="5165">He addressed Ynide and said, "Oh, lady of the palace,</l>
                <l n="5166">You know well that the king holds power over the world,</l>
                <l n="5167">And can raise or lower [people] in earthly glory.</l>
                <l n="5168">It is too astonishing, by the Virgin Queen [of Heaven],</l>
                <l n="5169">That you aren't willing to carry out his wish and his intention.</l>
                <l n="5170">What is the reason? Do you hate him?"</l>
                <l n="5171">The rosy-cheeked lady answered,</l>
                <l n="5172">"Hugo," she said, "you have me greatly under constraint</l>
                <l n="5173">When you ask me the secret of my hatred.</l>
                <l n="5174">Do you take me, friend, for a simple-minded girl,</l>
                <l n="5175">Such that my eyes can't distinguish between the rose and the thorn?</l>
                <l n="5176">I wasn't raised in the woods or in the forest,</l>
                <l n="5177">But truly in Lille, in Brois or in Menine.</l>
                <l n="5178">Indeed, my mother was neither blind nor cross-eyed,</l>
                <l n="5179">But [rather] was born of Broces, daughter of the duke of Saline.</l>
                <l n="5180">Her father was the lord of Flanders, up to the sea,</l>
                <l n="5181">His court was esteemed from here to Salumine.</l>
                <l n="5182">And I am the wife of the count who rules Unverise,</l>
                <l n="5183">And who is lord of Brabant, of Auvergne and of Cassine,</l>
                <l n="5184">And Roman senator because of his divine virtue.</l>
                <l n="5185">He who reminds me of the pain of my distress does evil!</l>
                <l n="5186">Now may death and I be very close cousins!"</l>
                <l n="5187">Tears from her eyes spilled down her breast,</l>
                <l n="5188">For will and sorrow ended mixed up together;</l>
                <l n="5189">She could scarcely keep from falling down to the stone [floor] of the
                    hall.</l>
